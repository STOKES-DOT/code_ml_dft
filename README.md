## Key Functions

* Transfroming smiles into .xyz and calculating descirptors for XC functionals optimization
* Mechine Learning Model for XC functionals optimization when calculating the charge-transfer excited or local excited state of singe molecular systems in TDDFT
* Scripts for batch generation of Gaussian tasks before and after optimization 

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need some python packages installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/STOKES-DOT/code_ml_dft

# Go into the repository
$ cd code_ml_dft

```

> **Note**
> Here, We give two XC funationals optimization code. If you want to create a new model for optimizing other XC functional, Please refer to our article in XXX (Will be pulished in a few time). 
> The final stacking model is not training because of the limit in Github's storage space. You need to finish training it by youself. Besides, each base-learners could also be used for optimization with a lower porfromeance.
> The packge needed for training stacking model is listed in packge.txt.

## Email

if you liked using this model or it has any questions about these codes or our theory details, I'd like you send me an email at <jiaoyuan24@mails.ucas.ac.cn> about anything you'd want to say about these codes. I'd really appreciate it!
