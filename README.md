## Key Functions

* Transfroming smiles into .xyz and calculating descirptors for XC functionals optimization
* Mechine Learning Model for XC functionals optimization when calculating the charge-transfer excited or local excited state of singe molecular systems in TDDFT
* Scripts for batch generation of Gaussian tasks before and after optimization

> **Note**
> Here, We give two XC funationals optimization code. If you want to create more codes for optimizing different XC functionals, Please refer to our article in XXX (Will be pulished in a few time). 
> The final stacking model is not training because of the limit in Github's storage space. You need to finish training it by youself.
> The packge needed for training stacking model is listed in packge.txt.
